Round Robin Scheduling
    Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.
    Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.
    Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period.
    Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.
Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm
Wait time of each process is as follows âˆ’
Process 	Wait Time : Service Time - Arrival Time
P0 	(0 - 0) + (12 - 3) = 9
P1 	(3 - 1) = 2
P2 	(6 - 2) + (14 - 9) + (20 - 17) = 12
P3 	(9 - 3) + (17 - 12) = 11
Average Wait Time: (9+2+12+11) / 4 = 8.5
